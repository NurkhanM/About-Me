    <string name="fish">Fishing is my hobby

There are a great number of hobbies in the world and I know a lot of interesting occupations but the most exciting for me is fishing. I prefer fishing because it is relaxing. It is so interesting to sit on the bank of the lake watching the float.
A lot of different fish may be caught in our lake. They are perches, crucians, ruffs, roaches, gudgeons and others.
I often go fishing with my parents. It usually happens in the morning and this day is the happiest for me. I am a lucky boy. I always catch many fish. But one day I was out of luck. It was my birthday. No fish was caught by me. At first I got upset but my sadness was not long. I suddenly realized that all the fish were alive – I hadn’t done any harm to these innocent creatures. They went on swimming in the lake.
And now I sometimes think about my hobby: is it really good? And what about you? Do you like fishing?</string>
